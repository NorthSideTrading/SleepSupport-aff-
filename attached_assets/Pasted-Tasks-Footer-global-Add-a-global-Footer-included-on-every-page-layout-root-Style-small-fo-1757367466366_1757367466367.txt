H1: Affiliate Disclosure
Body (template):
{SITE_NAME} participates in affiliate marketing programs. This means we may earn commissions when you click links or make purchases via links on our site. This comes at no extra cost to you.

Our editorial opinions are our own. Compensation may influence placement of offers but not our ratings or the facts we present.

We only recommend products we believe are genuinely useful based on our review process (see our Editorial Policy
).

Programs we participate in: {AFFILIATE_NETWORKS}. (Include the exact Amazon Associates sentence only if applicable: “As an Amazon Associate we earn from qualifying purchases.”)

H1: Editorial Policy
Body:
Our mission is to provide clear, useful reviews of physical products.
How we review:

Criteria: build quality, efficacy, value, customer feedback, third-party certifications.

Process: hands-on evaluation where possible; otherwise documentation, spec sheets, reputable lab reports, and verified customer data.

Independence: Writers and editors do not accept incentives to alter findings.

Corrections: We correct material errors promptly and note changes in “Updates.”

Funding & bias: Affiliate revenue may influence what we cover, but not how we rate. Our ratings reflect our criteria above.
Medical/health note (if relevant): Content is for informational purposes only and not medical advice. Consult a qualified professional.
