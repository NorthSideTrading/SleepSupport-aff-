Our goal is to elevate it from a basic review page to an expert-level, funnel-based marketing asset. All changes should be made on top of the current build.

1. Content Strategy & Overhaul
This is the most critical change. We are transforming the site from a list of products to a comprehensive, authoritative guide.

Implement a Narrative Flow:

Introduction: Begin the page with a problem-focused hook. Start with a relatable headline and an opening paragraph that discusses the common challenges of sleeplessness. Frame the supplements as a potential solution, not a magic bullet.

Educational Foundation: Before listing products, add a new section titled "Understanding Sleep Supplements" or "Key Ingredients for Better Sleep." This section should build trust and educate the user.

Ingredient Breakdown: Create a new subsection that breaks down the top 5-7 most common sleep supplement ingredients (e.g., Magnesium, Melatonin, L-Theanine, Chamomile, Valerian Root). For each ingredient, include:

A concise description of what it is.

How it works to promote sleep.

A brief summary of scientific evidence or a note about its traditional use.

Expert Endorsement: Add a small note or box titled "Expert-Reviewed" or "Backed by Science" to a prominent position near the top of the page. This is a crucial trust signal.

Enhance Product Descriptions:

Increase Total Copy: Expand the text for each affiliated product. The current descriptions are too brief.

Problem-Solution Angle: For each product, use a new headline that highlights a specific sleep problem it addresses (e.g., "For Tossing and Turning: [Product Name]").

Relate Content to Product: In the expanded description, explicitly connect the product's ingredients to the educational section above. For example, "This formula contains Magnesium Glycinate, a form we mentioned is known for its calming properties..."

Soft-Sell Language: Use benefit-oriented language. Instead of "This product has 500mg of Valerian Root," say, "The 500mg of Valerian Root in this supplement helps soothe your mind, preparing your body for a deeper rest."

2. Visual Enhancement & User Experience (UX)
The site needs a major visual upgrade to improve scannability, professionalism, and user trust.

Improve Typography and Hierarchy:

Change the overall site font to a clean, readable sans-serif font like Arial, Lato, or Open Sans. Ensure a consistent font size and color.

Utilize bolded headers (H2, H3) and subheadings to break up large blocks of text and guide the user's eye.

Use bulleted lists to present product benefits and key ingredients, making information easy to digest.

Increase line spacing and padding between elements to add more white space and reduce visual clutter.

Introduce Strategic Visuals:

Product Box Design: Re-design the container for each product. Each product should be in its own distinct, bordered box.

High-Quality Images: Use high-resolution, clear images of each product bottle or packaging. Ensure a consistent image size and aspect ratio.

Add Non-Product Images: Integrate new, relevant, and calming stock images throughout the article (e.g., a person sleeping peacefully, a glass of water with a supplement, an ingredient illustration). Place these images strategically to break up text and add visual appeal.

Implement Comparison Tables:

Create a new comparison table at the top of the product list. This table should summarize the key features of the top 3-4 recommended products.

Table Columns: Product Name, Key Ingredients, Best For... (e.g., Waking up at night, Stress-related sleeplessness), and a final CTA button.

3. Funnel & Soft-Sell Call-to-Actions (CTAs)
We will guide users toward the affiliate products using subtle but powerful prompts. DO NOT mention the word "guarantee" or any specific pricing.

Top-of-Page CTA: Add a small, unobtrusive section near the top of the page (below the introduction) that says, "Looking for our top pick? Click here to see the best-rated sleep supplement." This is an early exit point for motivated buyers.

Embedded In-Text Links:

Identify opportunities within the expanded product descriptions to link out.

In a sentence like "This product contains a clinically-studied dose of Melatonin," link the word "Melatonin" directly to the product's affiliate link.

Product Box CTAs:

Every product box must have a clear, prominent CTA button.

Button Text Options: Use action-oriented phrases like "Check Price & Reviews," "View on Amazon," or "Shop Now."

Pro Tip: Change the button text and color to create a clear visual hierarchy, with the top-ranked products having the most visually striking button.

Add a "Why Trust Us?" Section:

Create a new section near the bottom of the page that explains your methodology. This builds massive trust.

Possible content: "Our team researches products based on ingredient science, user reviews, and brand reputation," or "We connect you to trusted sellers for your convenience." This subtly explains your affiliate relationship without being overly technical.

Final Instruction for Replit Agent:

Review the current site and implement these changes systematically. The goal is a complete transformation, not a simple update. The final site should be a comprehensive, visually appealing, and expert-level resource that subtly guides users toward making a purchase.
