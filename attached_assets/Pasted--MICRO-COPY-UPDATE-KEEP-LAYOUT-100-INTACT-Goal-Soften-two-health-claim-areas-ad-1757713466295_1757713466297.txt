### MICRO COPY UPDATE – KEEP LAYOUT 100 % INTACT ###

Goal  
— Soften two health-claim areas + add standard FDA disclaimer.  
— Text should render subtle: Tailwind classes `text-xs text-slate-500`.  
— **Do not modify CTA buttons, images, GA4, HopLinks, or page spacing.**

––––– EDIT DETAILS –––––

1. **/sleep-weight-support/index.html**  
   a) **Headline tweak**  
      Replace current H1 text **“Can Your Body Burn Fat While You Sleep? We Put Sleeplean to the Test.”** with:  
      ```
      Supports Night-Time Metabolic Rate While You Sleep — Sleeplean Under the Microscope
      ```  
   b) **Panel table caption**  
      After the results table `<p class="text-xs ...">` line, append:  
      ```
      <span class="text-xs text-slate-500">Small internal pilot; individual outcomes are not guaranteed.</span>
      ```

2. **/pitch-black/index.html**  
   a) **Ingredient claim**  
      Find the line that reads **“support natural testosterone production”** and change to:  
      ```
      help maintain normal testosterone levels*
      ```  
      Add an asterisk.  
   b) **Footnote citation block** (right below that section, same paragraph):  
      ```
      <p class="text-xs text-slate-500 mt-2">
        *Supported by a placebo-controlled zinc study – <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8875519/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beydoun 1996</a>.
      </p>
      ```

3. **FDA / medical disclaimer** (all three LPs: sleep-weight-support, yu-sleep, pitch-black)  
   — Insert just **above the FAQ section** on each page:  
<p class="text-xs text-slate-500 mt-10"> These statements have not been evaluated by the Food & Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. </p> ```
Styling / structure notes
• Use existing Tailwind utility classes; no new CSS files.
• Do not add or remove div wrappers—just text nodes.
• Ensure headline font size class stays unchanged (text-3xl md:text-4xl). Only swap the inner text.
• All new links must include target="_blank" & rel="noopener".
