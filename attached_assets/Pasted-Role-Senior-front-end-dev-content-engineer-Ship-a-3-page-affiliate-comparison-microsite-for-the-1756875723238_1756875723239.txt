Role: Senior front-end dev + content engineer. Ship a 3-page, affiliate comparison microsite for the Sleep niche with a professional look for age 40+. Design for Google Search traffic to land on Devices first, then Supplements. Keep copy compliance-safe.

Objectives (non-negotiable)

Professional look (no rounded corners, no bubbly UI).

Age-40+ readable (base font 18–19px, high contrast, 1.6 line-height).

One clean funnel: Home → Devices hub (/sleep/devices/) → Outbound affiliate CTA; Home → Supplements hub (/sleep/supplements/) → Outbound affiliate CTA.

Claim safety: “helps reduce snoring,” “supports restful sleep,” not medical treatment.

Clear, above-the-fold affiliate disclosure on every page.

Outbound click tracking: Keitaro + GA4 event mirror with event-ID dedupe.

Hero:

H1: Sleep Help Hub: Compare Anti-Snore Devices & Sleep-Support Supplements (2025)

3-item FAQ.
Schema: FAQPage + BreadcrumbList.

Fitting tips (boil-and-bite, adjustment schedule).

FAQ x4 (mouthpiece vs nasal strips; adaptation time; cleaning; when to see a pro).
Schema: ItemList for top picks + FAQPage.
Copy guardrails: “helps reduce snoring,” “may help some adults,” “not for sleep apnea treatment.”

(You’ll replace CTA URLs with ShareASale/ClickBank links.)

Components & JS (/assets/js/main.js)

Build a sortable ComparisonTable that hydrates from /data/offers.json.

Two CTA buttons per row: Check Price (affiliate, new tab) and Read Review (placeholder).

Implement trackOutboundClick(e):

Create event_id (UUID v4).

Collect: offer, page_path, timestamp, pass-through gclid, fbclid, utm_*.

Keitaro: GET/POST to tracking endpoint (leave placeholder URL + comment).

GA4: gtag('event','outbound_click',{offer, page_path, event_id}).

Don’t block navigation—sendBeacon/fetch with keepalive.

SEO

Titles ≤ 60 chars; meta descriptions 150–160 chars; canonicals.

BreadcrumbList across pages.

H1 mirrors query.

No brand names in H1s (except future VS pages).

Create robots.txt and basic sitemap.xml.

Compliance copy (drop-in blocks)

Affiliate disclosure (header):
Disclosure: We may earn a commission if you buy through our links. Our picks are editorial and not medical advice.

Devices disclaimer (below fold):
Anti-snore mouthpieces may help reduce snoring for some adults. They are not a treatment for sleep apnea or other medical conditions. Consider professional care if you have severe symptoms.

Supplements disclaimer (footer):
These products are intended to support relaxation and sleep quality. They are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Talk to a healthcare professional about your situation.

Routing (for Google Ads later)

Generic device keywords → /sleep/devices/

Generic supplement keywords → /sleep/supplements/

“Brand A vs Brand B” → future /sleep/brand-a-vs-brand-b/ (SEO only unless whitelisted).

Add negatives: apnea, CPAP, cure, diagnosis, FDA approved, lawsuit, side effects, reddit, scam and any brands you’re not promoting.

Design polish

No rounded corners. Subtle 1px dividers.

Professional font stack, high contrast, restrained color.

Icons for Fit/Comfort/Care columns.

Hero art: tasteful, high-contrast vector (no cheesy stock).

Acceptance criteria

All 3 pages built and linked; Lighthouse (mobile) Perf ≥ 90, A11y ≥ 90.

Tables load from JSON; sorting works.

Outbound clicks fire Keitaro + GA4 stubs with unique event_id.

Disclosures visible without scrolling on mobile.

Schema validates (ItemList + FAQ).

No medical claims anywhere.
