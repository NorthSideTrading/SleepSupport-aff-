Duplicate the structure and layout of the page at /sleep/supplements/ to the existing route /non-pill-solutions (do not alter /sleep/supplements/). Keep the same design system, components, CSS classes, spacing, and review card layout. Replace only context (text, images, links, metadata) so it fits Non-Pill Sleep Solutions (devices/gear, not supplements).

Find & Base Template

Locate the source files that render /sleep/supplements/ (page file + any section/partial components it imports).

Confirm the existing /non-pill-solutions route. If it exists, refactor it to reuse the same components/layout as the supplements page. If it’s a different template, align it to the supplements page structure. If it does not exist, create it using the supplements template.

Content Replacements (Non-Pill Solutions):
Use these five products (title, brand, URL). Replace the supplements list/cards with this exact list in the same order:

LectroFan Classic White Noise Machine — Brand: Sound of Sleep — URL: https://www.soundofsleep.com/product/lectrofan-classic/

Hatch Restore 3 (Sunrise Alarm & Sound Machine) — Brand: Hatch — URL: https://www.hatch.co/restore

Eight Sleep Pod 5 (Bed Cooling System) — Brand: Eight Sleep — URL: https://www.eightsleep.com/product/pod5ultra/

Gravity Original Weighted Blanket — Brand: Gravity Blankets — URL: https://gravityblankets.com/products/gravity-blanket

SnoreRx Adjustable Mouthguard (anti-snoring) — Brand: SnoreRx — URL: https://snorerx.com/

Card Content Rules (apply to each item):

Keep the same visual card template used on /sleep/supplements/.

Swap titles, brand names, and outbound CTAs to the URLs above.

Set CTA links to rel="sponsored nofollow" and target="_blank".

Add short, factual blurbs (2–3 bullets) per item tailored to devices (no medical claims):

LectroFan: consistent digital white noise; no looping; volume range.

Hatch Restore 3: sunrise wake, wind-down sounds; phone-free bedside use.

Eight Sleep Pod 5: active cooling/heating cover; dual-zone if applicable; app control.

Gravity Blanket: deep-pressure “calming”; multiple weights/sizes; machine-wash cover.

SnoreRx Mouthguard: adjustable mandibular advancement; boil-and-bite fit; nightly use.

Add meaningful alt text for all images (e.g., “LectroFan Classic white noise machine on nightstand”). If images don’t exist, generate placeholder filenames under /assets/img/non-pill/ using kebab-case (e.g., lectrofan-classic.jpg) and wire them in (leave placeholders in repo if real images absent).

For SnoreRx, add a small Note under the card: “For snoring only; not a treatment for sleep apnea. If you suspect apnea, talk to a clinician.”

Page-Level Copy (replace ‘supplement’ language):

H1: “Non-Pill Sleep Solutions: Gear That Helps You Sleep Better”

Subhead: “Real-world tools for noise, light, temperature, and snoring—no pills required.”

Add a short “How These Help” section with 4 badges/mini-blocks:

Noise (sound machines)

Light (sunrise alarm / dim bedside lights)

Temperature (bed cooling)

Snoring (mouthguard / nasal airflow aids)

Internal link in intro: “Prefer vitamins and botanicals? See our Sleep Supplements page.” → link to /sleep/supplements/.

SEO & Metadata (match supplements page structure, new values):

<title>: “Non-Pill Sleep Solutions | SleepSupportGuide”

<meta name="description">: “5 proven non-pill sleep solutions—white noise, sunrise alarm, bed cooling, weighted blanket, and an adjustable anti-snoring mouthguard.”

Canonical: https://www.sleepsupportguide.com/non-pill-solutions/

Open Graph/Twitter: update title/description/og:url/og:image to match this page.

Breadcrumbs: Home » Sleep » Non-Pill Solutions (mirror supplements breadcrumb style).

Structured Data (JSON-LD):
Add an ItemList of Product (position 1–5) with name, brand, url, and placeholder image. Do NOT invent ratings or prices; omit those fields if unknown.

Tracking & Events (preserve existing):

Keep existing GTM snippet and GA4 events intact.

On each product CTA, add data-gtm="ssg_product_cta" and data-product-name="<exact title>" so GTM can bind click tracking (page context = non_pill_solutions).

Do not change measurement IDs. (FYI: GA4 = G-PRMWNW40K2; GTM = GTM-PMD5N2V4—use what’s already in the repo.)

Nav, Footer, and Links:

Update site nav to include “Non-Pill Solutions” if the supplements page appears there (match style).

Footer legal links remain: Privacy, Terms, Editorial Policy, Affiliate Disclosure.

Add an inline disclosure near the top or above the product grid: “We may earn a commission from links on this page.”

Sitemap & Robots:

If sitemap.xml exists, ensure /non-pill-solutions/ is included with today’s lastmod.

Page should be indexable (index,follow).

Quality Pass / Acceptance Criteria:

/non-pill-solutions/ renders with the same layout as /sleep/supplements/, but with the 5 non-pill products and updated copy/SEO.

All five outbound CTAs open in new tabs and include rel="sponsored nofollow".

No “supplement” wording remains on the page body except the internal link referencing the supplements page.

JSON-LD validates (no fake ratings/prices).

Lighthouse: no broken images/links, no major SEO errors.

Build and run locally; provide the path(s) of files changed.
