Instruction: Ensure that all headings from H1 to H4 have a clear and distinct size hierarchy, with H1 being the largest and H4 being the smallest.

Instruction: Use bolded text to highlight key terms and concepts within paragraphs and bulleted lists. This makes the article scannable and allows users to quickly find the information they are looking for.

Section 3.4: Integrating Soft-Sell CTAs

Directive: Integrate a layered approach to soft-sell calls to action throughout the page.



In-line Text CTAs:
